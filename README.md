### Hello there! 🫡

I'm Roy, I blend Full-Stack Engineering with Cybersecurity.

I'm generally curious about how systems work, break, and how to maintain them while continuously learning.

My main tech stack is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

Here is one of my favorite pinned projects (link-placeholder)

Everyday is a journey in creating repos, building something, and learning something new in the process.

#### Fun Facts:

* I began studying Full-Stack Engineering, but now I'm passionate about Cybersecurity!
* I have a VM Home Lab focused on security, but work on Full-Stack Projects on my free time
* **Hobbies:** Writing and Producing Music, Creating Beats
